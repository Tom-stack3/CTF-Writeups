**Description**
> A prison officer from Roscow State Prison was on a routine patrol when he saw a pair of blinking lights, a loud sound and then a thud. Knowing that a drone had possibly just dropped contraband, he ran into the yard with his flashlight. Seeing a long, hanging cord of string, he grabbed it and pulled hard. Unfortunately the drone flew away, but the base part of the system was attached to the string. The serial number reads: **37QBHC100B0092** Can you please decode or figure out what kind of drone it was? If you find the Make, Model and Manufacture Date, we can match it to the registration and arrest the operator. Flag Format is FLAG{make-model-DD-MM-YYYY}
