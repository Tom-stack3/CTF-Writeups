**Description**
> A member of the public sent the NSW Police this photo taken from a bridge as to the the last place they saw a criminal. After seeing the criminal walked along this path to the beach, the criminal robbed several houses in the area. The only detail that could be pointed out was that they wore suspenders. The owner of a local refreshment store could have been another witness - can you please provide the mobile phone number of the witness?

## Solution

After searching for "suspension bridge in new south wales", I found the right one that matched the picture:

https://www.google.com/maps/place/Parsley+Bay+Bridge/@-33.8508271,151.2771635,17z/data=!4m9!1m2!2m1!1ssuspension+bridge+in+new+south+wales!3m5!1s0x6b12ac592876f435:0x58729d28f14ab644!8m2!3d-33.8501625!4d151.2775268!15sCiRzdXNwZW5zaW9uIGJyaWRnZSBpbiBuZXcgc291dGggd2FsZXNaJiIkc3VzcGVuc2lvbiBicmlkZ2UgaW4gbmV3IHNvdXRoIHdhbGVzkgEGYnJpZGdlmgEkQ2hkRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVVJUWjJaNU5YRkJSUkFC

So the bridge is called "Parsley Bay Bridge".\
Now let's find the so called "refreshment store" nearby.

There is a kiosk near the bridge, named "Parsley Bay Cafe Kiosk".

The owner of the cafe is Giovanni Trione. Now let's do some professional stalking.

His email address is gtrione@gmail.com.

Found his facebook and twitter accounts:
- https://www.facebook.com/giovanni.trione.14
- https://mobile.twitter.com/giovannitrione/

After digging for a while, found his phone number in a comment he made on facebook:
