**Description**
> A ping came through on slack - one of our sock puppet accounts monitoring Raidforums has discovered a unique dataset being shared. It appears to be the removable SD card of a drone. Our drone expert in Helsinki is tied up with other work but said itâ€™s important to note it does not appear to be the on-board storage SD. Investigators believe this may be tied to a counter-terrorism case, but need to confirm the details, can you help them fill in the gaps? First off, what is the serial number of the drone (not the Machine ID)? Flag format is FLAG{serial}

## Solution
At first I didn't know how to read the data of the SD card.
After some research I found the following thread: https://mavicpilots.com/threads/logs-inside-the-sd-card-i-want-to-know.91756/,
So I downloaded DatCon and CsvView on an old windows machine and changed the log files extension to `.DAT`.

By opening the camera_log file in the CsvView program, we get the mcId of the drone, which is: 1SDCH87016BMZQ.
But we need the serial number and not the machine ID.
We also get the machine version, which is v3.4.6.43.

After some digging, I decided to export the camera_log.DAT which I opened with CsvView to a csv file.
I looked through the csv file, searching for words like "sn" and "serial", and found a very strange cell, which contained lots of text.
I copied it to a text file and opened it with.
Used the regex expression "[A-Z0-9]{14}" to highlight serial numbers, and voilÃ !
Found the following row:
```
 2721 [L-FMU/VERSION]Ac  SN  :1SZCH8F4T2DNPK|   2721 [L-FMU/VERSION]Mc  ID  :1SDCH87016BMZQ|   2721 [L-FMU/VERSION]Bat SN  :1U5X07WEXP000R|   2721 [L-FMU/VERSION]Mc  Ver :v3.4.6.43|   2721 [L-FMU/VERSION]Bat Ver :v5.0.10.18| 
```

Here we can clearly see three numbers.\
After checking in http://tools.retroroms.info/, `1SZCH8F4T2DNPK` is indeed the serial number of the drone.\
`1SDCH87016BMZQ` is the machine ID of the drone that we already encountered, and `1U5X07WEXP000R` was apparently the battery serial number.\
I guess that we solved two challenges, at the same time.

## Solution
Obviously, looked at the `GPS:Lat` and `GPS:Long` columns, and found the coordinates of the drone's flight.

First row coordinates:
`Lat: -37.8165806, Long: 144.9344869`

Therefore, Melbourne, Australia.

## Solution
I actually solved this challence first, and I didn't tried CsvView yet, but DatCon was fine for this one.

So I downloaded DatCon, changed the log files extension to .DAT and ran DatCon on the files.
The fc_log file showed some errors while being parsed, but still a fc_log.csv file was created.
The camera_log file was also successfully parsed and a camera_log.csv file was generated.
After inspecting both csv files, the date of the oldest flight log (in the `GPS:Date` column) from both files is: `2020-10-30`.

> Got it - so we have the list of days the flights were involved. To check what the weather was that day, we tried pulling the data from the meteorologists...unfortunately, their expert told us "wind can travel in any direction depending on environmental objects". Damn it. Can you please read the data recorded to the drone about the wind direction of the most recent flight, and what the average direction was? Flag format is FLAG{direction}

**Attachments**
> seized drone contents.zip

## Solution
At first I thought the direction should be a number (degree), because it was in this format in the CSV log file.\
So I used Excel to calculate the average direction of the wind direction column, (at first I assumed it was `AirSpeed:windDirection`, so avg is 0).\
After that didn't work, I tried another column (`IMU_ATTI(0):directionOfTravel[mag]:C`) but that didn't work either.\

After some more tries, I loaded up the csv file into CsvView and saw that the wind is to the north (`AirSpeed:windDirection` 0).\
And I understood that maybe the direction is supposed to be a literal direction (north, south, east, west) and not a number.\
So I tried FLAG{north} and it worked! ðŸ¥³

**Description**
> Thanks for all the information so far - however, we still need to know what happened in that final flight. Keep in mind, this might pop up in court, we need to be completely right here. We've come up with a few options, but obviously the only real way to know is from the data. A little OSINT wouldn't hurt either! Options: ran out of battery, entered no-fly-zone, caught in a tree, caught in powerlines, landed with no issue, crashed into the ground, downed with jammer, downed by hacking, drifted away by wind, critical system failure. Flag format is FLAG{the full text answer}

> seized drone contents.zip

## Solution
- Ran out of battery: no. checked the "BatteryInfo:CapPercentage:D" column in the drone's flight log.
- Entered no-fly-zone: probably not, after looking in the map, the drone basically flew over the same area for the whole flight.
- Drifted away by wind: no. the wind speed was very low, so it was not a drift away.

I used the CsvView tool to look at the drone's path.

I didn't see any powerlines in the area, so I assumed the drone didn't crash into one.\
I also saw that the drown's altitude was too high in the end of the flight for the drone to land, so I assumed it didn't crash into the ground nor landed with no issues.\
I also didn't see any system failures indicators in the csv.\
Also, by looking at the area of the drone's flight, I saw that it was flying between lots of trees, and in the end it kinda looked like he crashed into one.
Therefore I assumed that the drone crashed into a tree, and I was right. :)
